                Geography and nature
            </h3>
            <p>
                <span>Italy is located in Southern Europe in the Mediterranean.</span> A large part of the country lies on the Apennine Peninsula. The territory is mainly hilly and mountainous. From the north, Italy is supported by the Southern Alps, and the Apennine Mountains are located on the peninsula. The territory of the country is located at the point of contact of lithospheric plates, so earthquakes are not rare here. In addition, several large volcanoes are located here: Etna, Vesuvius, etc. <br>Due to geographical and climatic features, nature is very diverse in the entire area of Italy. Although most of the topography of the territory has been changed by human activity since ancient times. In the north, on the slopes of the Alps, mixed and coniferous forests grow, on the coast and in the south - subtropical plants. The central part of the country is a mixture of nature of subtropics and temperate latitudes.

            </h3>
            <p>
                The climate of Italy is very diverse and can be very different from the Mediterranean in some regions. In most of the territory, the summer is very warm and dry, and July is the warmest month. Autumn is usually rainy. Winters are cool and wet (hence frequent fogs) in the north and milder in the south. In the provinces located in the foothills of the Alps, the climate is mountainous. Summer is cool, and winter is cold and snowy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Italy has a favorable warm climate. Although the conditions are a bit harsher in the Alps and it can be quite cold in the foothills. Choosing the best time to visit involves weighing several factors: hotel and food prices, weather, cultural events, and seasonal atmosphere. The peak season is summer. If you want to come to Italy to explore its wonderful cultural and historical heritage, then it is better to choose the lowest season - winter. <span>The optimal time </span> in terms of weather and number of tourists <span>is April-May and September-October.</span>
